# 🚨 Police Data Analysis with Python

This project explores real-world police stop data to uncover patterns and insights using Python and Pandas. The dataset originates from a police checkpoint and includes detailed records of stops, violations, driver demographics, and enforcement actions.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to clean, explore, and visualize key aspects of law enforcement data. The project walks through essential data operations including:

- 🚿 Data cleaning (e.g., dropping columns with only missing values)
- 📊 Filtering and counting categorical data (e.g., gender analysis for speeding violations)
- 🔍 Group-based analysis (e.g., how search decisions vary by gender)
- 🧠 Mapping and data type conversions for derived metrics (e.g., average stop duration)
- 📈 Statistical comparisons (e.g., age distributions across violation types)
